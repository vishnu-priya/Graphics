Implemented anit-aliasing, by splitting the cell into 4 further pieces.
Source code:
void Render_World::Render()
{
  int n = 4;
  for(int j=0;j<camera.number_pixels[1];j++)
  for(int i=0;i<camera.number_pixels[0];i++)
  for(int p=0;p<n; p++ )
  for(int q=0;q<n; q++ )
  Render_Pixel(ivec2(i+p/n,j+q/n), n);
}
Every cell has 4 rays passing through it now, compared to the single ray earlier. This increases the computation time of the program, taking significantly longer to execute.
